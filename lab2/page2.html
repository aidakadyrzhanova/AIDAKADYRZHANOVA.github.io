<p>Oil is the core of the entire economy of Atyrau. The biggest oil producer in the region is <b>Tengizchevroil</b>, a joint Kazakh-American venture, which explores the Tengiz oil field. The company is also the biggest taxpayer and employer. Moreover, Tengizchevroil supports a wide range of social projects in Atyrau and the entire region. 

<br> Moreover, there is an oil refinery plant in Atyrau â€“ a strategic object for our country. It was built during World War II (the Soviet Union bought the plant in the U.S.) and it is still one of the biggest refineries in the country. The plant produces gasoline and diesel fuel for Uralsk, Aktau and Aktobe. 

<br> The vast majority of people in Atyrau prefer to work in the oil industry, not in the state or quasi-state sectors. The wage in the industry is $700 on average even though some earn $3000 or even $7000 per month. Usually, for this kind of wage, only those who have a degree certificate and work experience are eligible. Another area to make money is a group of businesses, which are aimed at serving the oil industry. They also offer employees good wages.</p>
